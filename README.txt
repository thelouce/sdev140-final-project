/*** CAT GAME USER MANUAL ***/

The story of Cat Game is simple. You are a mortal who has given up your human form to the elder god Kili in exchange for a new demonic presence. Your goal is to achieve world domination. Cat Game is not complete, but you can go through character creation quite easily.

Character Creation will check to make sure all data you input is valid. The name entry must be a String, while the age entry will check for integers. The final data input is to pick from a dropdown and select your cat picture. Since I only drew so many cats, you cannot enter any cat color you'd like.

As for the changes from my initial project proposal:
- I was not able to finish the gameplay. However, I feel the project works as it is.
- I was not able to program the windows to function together. I tried, but it did not work properly and I got frustrated and gave up. In the future I will attempt this. Instead, the windows serve as a "reset" button, as you can close the character creation window to restart character creation at any time.
- I had ambitions of creating a save feature, but did not have the time to study to implement it.

As for the source of all graphics: I drew them myself. In the future, I will need to use a proper pixel art program instead of Clip Studio Paint, as I noticed a lot of stray pixels that I did not have time to clean up.
